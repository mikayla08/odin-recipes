    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This traditional Japanese dish is all deep-fried Horse Mackerel and all delicious. The crispy bread crumb coating will perfectly compliment those fish you've been reeling in while hunting for exotic sea creatures off the coast of your island. Pair it with shredded lettuce on the side and a hearty dish of Tonkatsu sauce and you've got yourself a meal! Fun fact: "aji" (鯵 (the fish)) is very close to "aji" (味), the japanese word for "taste". Only the intonations are different, leading people to say that the reason why the fish is called 鯵 is because it has a good 味 (taste)! The more you know.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>4 horse mackerels (whole, medium size)</ul>
        <ul>¼ tsp salt</ul>
        <ul>¼ tsp pepper</ul>
        <ul>1½ tbsp flour</ul>
        <ul>1 egg beaten</ul>
        <ul>1½ cup panko breadcrumbs</ul>
        <ul>Oil for deep-frying</ul>
        <h4>For Serving:</h4>
        <ul>Shredded lettuce</ul>
        <ul>Tonkatsu sauce</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of butterflied fish fillets.</ol>
        <ol>Working one fillet at a time, coat a fillet with flour, then pat to shake off excess flour. Place it in the egg and coat all over. Allow excess egg to drip, then transfer to the breadcrumbs.</ol>
        <ol>Cover the entire fish with breadcrumbs, and gently press down so that a good layer of breadcrumbs is stuck on both sides. Repeat for the rest of the fillets.</ol>
        <ol>Heat oil in a frying pan to 170°C / 338°F. The oil should be about 3cm / 1¼” deep.</ol>
        <ol>Gently place the crumbed fish skin side up. Do not crowd the oil with too many fish pieces (note 5). Cook for about 1-1½ minutes, then turn the fish over. Cook for further 1 minutes or so, until golden brown (note 6).</ol>
        <ol>Transfer the fried fish to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain excess oil.</ol>
        <ol>Place two Aji Fry pieces with shredded lettuce on each serving plate. Serve immediately with the sauce of your choice.</ol>
