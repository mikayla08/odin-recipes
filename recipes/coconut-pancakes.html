    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Looking for a more tropical fare? Got lots of coconuts to spare? Look no further than this sweet stack of coconut pancakes! I hear that some villagers would even pay a hearty sum of Bells to get their hands on these pancakes! Plus, they just look really cute when displayed in your kitchen. Food that's delicious and visually appealing-- what more could you ask for? </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>1 cup shredded sweetened coconut</ul>
        <ul>2 cups white whole wheat flour</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons coconut sugar</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons baking powder</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon baking soda</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>2 cups coconut milk beverage</ul>
        <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
        <il>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</il>
        <ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>Butter and coconut syrup (for serving)</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Evenly spread out the coconut on a large baking sheet. Bake for 5-7 minutes, stirring once, until coconut is slightly toasted. Remove from oven and set aside.</ol>
        <ol>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, coconut oil, and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Do not over mix.</ol>
        <ol>Heat a griddle or pan to medium low heat. Coat with cooking spray. Drop about a â…“ cup of batter onto heated skillet. Sprinkle pancakes with toasted coconut. Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, about 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, about 2 minutes more. Continue making pancakes until the batter and toasted coconut is gone. Serve warm with butter and coconut syrup, if desired.</ol>
